# Restaurant recommender system
 
Location based simple restaurant recommender system using Kaggle Yelp dataset.

Recommendation systems are widely utilized in different applications for predicting the preference or rating of a user in a product or service. These Recommender systems can be of different types and the most prominent ones include Content-based filtering and Collaborativefiltering. 
In this project, I will demonastrate location-based recommendations, where we specifically focus on geographic locations to render more relevant recommendations utilizing the location of the users.
To illustrate the crucial aspects of location-based recommenders I will perform a simple Location-based recommendation using the K-Means algorithm with Yelp Dataset from Kaggle.
